# Benefits of signing commits
Proving identity: Github allows for any user to set their name and email to what they desire in their configuration. This also will be reflected on the Github UI. This is for Github is not a security vulnerability. User A who wants to impersonate User B can't access B's private repositories for example without an access token. However, it is troublesome to guess if a commit actually came from a specific person. To address this issue, Github allows users to store SSH or GPG public keys in their account. User A will use the private key stored locally to verify (sign) the commits he/she carried out. Thus if someone is known to verify (sign) all their commits, and a new unverified one is published, it is safer to ignore that commit. Problems like this may happen in private organizations as well if a member wants to act maliciously and hide their commits under another person's identity.
